# Data Processing Code

This directory contains code for sampling data for training and
evaluating models on single client continual learning, few-shot learning benchmarks.

## Reminder:

No actual data (or any binary or otherwise code-generated or
reproducible file/product) should be checked in to the github
repository. Any data should be stored/accessed by a different method
(e.g., Google Drive, on server, etc...)
